This is a simple example of a Gogo Shell command for inspecting the contents of a liferaycloud GCS bucket

There are two commands:

- countFiles - print a summary of files and their sizes
- listFiles - print out all the files in the bucket

Note that this has only been tested with small numbers of document library files. For navigating larger document libaries the code could be modified to run in the background.
